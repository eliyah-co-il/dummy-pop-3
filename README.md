# dummy-pop-3
The dummy-pop-3 script can be invoked by xinetd and simulates a fully functional POP3 server serving one email. It accepts any combination of user and pass.
The email can be downloaded, deleted and recovered on the server.
If the username contains the string "eicar", an eicar infected email will be delivered. This can be used to test inline AV solutions.
