The Dummy POP3 script is a handy little script, if you need a POP3 server quick for
testing. It is fully STD53 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/std53) compliant!
It can be used for:

- testing POP3 clients
- testing AV email solutions
- honeypot for POP3 (records all user/pass combinations tried)

It will accept any combination of user and pass and will always deliver one email.
If part of the username is "eicar", it will deliver an email with an attached file
containing the EICAR virus signature.
