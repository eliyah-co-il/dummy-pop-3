INSTALL

The dummy pop3 server is a bash script executed by an interet
super server, e.g. xinetd. An xinetd config file is provided
with the code.

It requires (only) the following packages/binaries
- bash
- xinetd
- logger (logs requests to the mail log, part of bsdutils)

This should do the installation just fine in most distries:

cp dummypop3.sh /opt/bin/
chmod 755 /opt/bin/dummypop3.sh
cp xinetd.d/pop3 /etc/xinted.d/
/etc/init.d/xinetd restart

Now port 110 should listen to POP3 and and logins are logged
to the mail.log facility of syslog.

The script is invoced as "nobody", so make sure the nobody
user can execute the script in its location!
